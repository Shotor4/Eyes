# Eyes


Move your mouse and the eyes will follow! DOM was used to link with the javascript.


* There are a few different ways to get this repository. Below I have listed 2 ways.

    - Fork and clone the repo
    - Download the Zip file and extract the file.
* Inside the folder, open index.html in any internet browser
* Move the mouse and you will see the eyes following the pointer.

##Future improvements will be:
* Make Eyes close and open by time
* Add more buttons to the project for adding more eyes, changing eye appearance, etc
* Remove any eye
